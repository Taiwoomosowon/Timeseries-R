Concrete is widely employed in the construction sector for many different projects, including buildings, bridges, and roadways. Concrete's strength is essential for determining whether it can be used in construction, because insufficient strength can result in safety risks, higher costs, and project delays. For large-scale construction projects, waiting for 28 days to ascertain the compressive strength of concrete is frequently impracticable and time-consuming, necessitating the development of a more effective and precise procedure. By examining the variables that determine compressive strength of concrete, such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, and aggregate proportions, as well as the age of concrete, this research study seeks to construct a multiple regression model that can predict compressive strength. Buildings, bridges, and roads are just a few of the many various projects that use concrete extensively in the construction industry. Because insufficient strength can lead to safety issues, greater costs, and project delays, concrete's strength is crucial in deciding whether it can be utilized in construction. It is sometimes impractical and time-consuming to wait 28 days to determine the compressive strength of concrete for large-scale construction projects, necessitating the creation of a more exact and effective process. This study aims to develop a multiple regression model that can forecast compressive strength by looking at the factors that affect concrete's compressive strength, including cement, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, and aggregate proportions, as well as the age of the concrete. Regression analysis was carried out again after the inconsequential factors were eliminated, and the results revealed that all variables were significant predictors of compressive strength. Water had a negative impact on compressive strength, but cement, slag, ash, and age had beneficial impacts. Superplasticizer had a beneficial impact, but it was less significant
